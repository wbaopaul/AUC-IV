**Title**: Estimation of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) under nonignorable verification bias

**Authors**: Wenbao Yu, Jae-Kwang Kim, and Taesung Park

Here are some illustration of the codes:
- All the source codes are given in **auc_IV_test.R** 
- We called some C codes to spead up some part of the calculation. C codes are listed in **estAUC_nonIg_Rcpp.cpp**
- To run a simulation example, see **simu_test.R**
